* **Instructions**

  * Add a delete button into the `index.handlebars` file next to each burger.

  * Add on to the following:

  * The `burgers.js` file to add a jQuery event handler for the delete button.
  * The ORM to include a delete key and function
  * The burger model to include a delete key and function that uses the ORM
  * The `burgersController.js` file to have a `/api/burgers/:id` delete route, to call the delete key of the burger model, and to pass in arguments as necessary
